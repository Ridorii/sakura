Don\'t get the [owner](http://flashii.net/u/2) in legal trouble.\r\n\r\nBut to not make the moderation system of the site entirely communist you are always allowed to talk to the [admin](http://flashii.net/u/2) about a certain moderator (although reds and greens are untouchable) and their status.\r\n\r\n## Cross Site\r\n\r\n**We do not endorse any attacks, raids, name the internet drama form, etc on other sites.

To activate it, simply add the file extension of the language you want to use directly after the first code \"fence\", ` ``` js `, and syntax highlighting will automatically be applied in the rendered HTML. For example, to apply syntax highlighting to JavaScript code:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n``` javascript\r\ngrunt.initConfig({\r\n  assemble: {\r\n    options: {\r\n      assets: \'docs/assets\',\r\n      data: \'src/data/*.{json,yml}\',\r\n      helpers: \'src/custom-helpers.js\',\r\n      partials: [\'src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}\']\r\n    },\r\n    pages: {\r\n      options: {\r\n        layout: \'default.hbs\'\r\n      },\r\n      files: {\r\n        \'./\': [\'src/templates/pages/index.hbs\']\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nRenders to:\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\ngrunt.initConfig({\r\n  assemble: {\r\n    options: {\r\n      assets: \'docs/assets\',\r\n      data: \'src/data/*.{json,yml}\',\r\n      helpers: \'src/custom-helpers.js\',\r\n      partials: [\'src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}\']\r\n    },\r\n    pages: {\r\n      options: {\r\n        layout: \'default.hbs\'\r\n      },\r\n      files: {\r\n        \'./\': [\'src/templates/pages/index.hbs\']\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this complicated HTML:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span class=\"nx\">grunt</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">initConfig</span><span class=\"p\">({</span>\r\n  <span class=\"nx\">assemble</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\r\n    <span class=\"nx\">options</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\r\n      <span class=\"nx\">assets</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"s1\">\'docs/assets\'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\r\n      <span class=\"nx\">data</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"s1\">\'src/data/*.{json,yml}\'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\r\n      <span class=\"nx\">helpers</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"s1\">\'src/custom-helpers.js\'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\r\n      <span class=\"nx\">partials</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s1\">\'src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}\'</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\r\n    <span class=\"p\">},</span>\r\n    <span class=\"nx\">pages</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\r\n      <span class=\"nx\">options</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\r\n        <span class=\"nx\">layout</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"s1\">\'default.hbs\'</span>\r\n      <span class=\"p\">},</span>\r\n      <span class=\"nx\">files</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\r\n        <span class=\"s1\">\'./\'</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s1\">\'src/templates/pages/index.hbs\'</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\r\n      <span class=\"p\">}</span>\r\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\r\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\r\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\r\n</pre></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tables\r\nTables are created by adding pipes as dividers between each cell, and by adding a line of dashes (also separated by bars) beneath the header.

To prevent the site from being down during those 3 weeks I\'ll be moving the server over to Djjuul13\'s house (who I know IRL).\r\n\r\nThis means that the DNS settings for the domains will have to be changed.
