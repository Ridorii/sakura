## Requirements

- PHP 5.5.0 or newer
- A database engine compatible with your PHP install and Laravel/Illuminate's database abstraction layer.

_these will likely update in the future because i'm planning to go php 7 only_

## Contributing

Right now I'm not accepting big PRs because of a set of big things not being fully implemented yet, bug fix PRs are more than welcome though!
